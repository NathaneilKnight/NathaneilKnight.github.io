## Research Interests

- Phylogenetics
- **Neuroscience**
- Mental disorder
- Neural circuits of adaptive behaviors

My current research focuses on the evolution of Commelinaceae and its phylogenetic relationship based on the transciptome data. My research interests are on the **Neuroscience** and its application in human health. In a word, Neuroscience positively influence the life of everybody.  Although there is a little gap between my current research and my interests, I've got a good command of the basic knowledge and skills needed for future research. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
